## Internship

### Capgemini Consulting, Algorithm Engineer Assistant
Work on logistics routing problem and use Python to model the VRPTW model. The dijkstra 
algorithm, kmeans and hierarchical clustering algorithms are mainly used to complete the 
path finding of the model and clustering of all orders. At the same time, the two-opt algorithm 
is also used to solve the self-intersection problem of the path. In the test results of multiple 
data sets, the full load rate exceeds 80%, and the result graph can show excellent routing 
effect.
- Using: Python, sklearn, numpy, algorithm design

### Bytedance, Computer Vision Engineer Assistant
Used OpenCV, pytorch, COCO, and other language libraries to process large image databases, divide 
image datasets and convert them into coco format json files, and used YOLOv8 and EfficientDet models to
 perform target detection on image data.
 - Using: Python, pytorch, coco, Yolov8, OpenCV

## Projects

### MATP 4910 - Data Analytics Research (DAR-DeFi-LTM-F24) - A

Accomplish the design and implementation of a classification model development framework for survival data analysis alone, taking 
responsibility for key components including data preprocessing, model development and optimization, and performance evaluation. Developed efficient preprocessing scripts to clean data, engineer features, and address class imbalance; created customized 
evaluation functions to consolidate multiple performance metrics with intuitive visualizations; and implemented and optimized various classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.), transforming complex survival datasets into 
actionable classification tasks with high predictive accuracy.
- Using: R

### Rensselaer Center for Open Scource(RCOS) DEFI-analysis - A

Perform data mining and feature engineering on Decentralized finance data, and use sklearn's five machine learning models to predict the rise or fall of a certain currency price in the future. The highest success rate reaches 79.17%.
- Using: Python

### Research program with professor Chirag Shah in University of Washington - AI

Research on Contemporary Issues in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Models. 
Prediction and Classification on Diverse Datasets using sklearn.
- Utilized the sklearn library for prediction and classification tasks on datasets
- Analyzed and evaluated model performance, and conducted tuning

### Intel Edge-X Coding Competition - 1st Place, 2000 dollars prize

Led team in the Edge-X competition supported by Intel, focusing on developing an interactive program 
named TT -- an open-source tracking network providing IoT devices with relative location information 
independent of high power consumption or satellite signals. Spearheaded API creation for seamless 
integration, utilizing Matter for Bluetooth transmission and location recognition akin to AirTag. Undertook 
diverse responsibilities, including API writing, computational algorithm development, documentation,and C++
implementation for Matter connections.
- Using: Python, C++, Go

### Rensselaer Center for Open Source(RCOS) MunchiMaps - A (Fall 2024)

Developed a Python-based system to manage vending machine data, including real-time availability and 
location. Implemented algorithms for shortest path optimization and finding nearest vending machines based 
on user needs. Demonstrated strong skills in data modeling and algorithm design.
